## ForEach loops in T-SQL

Did you know T-SQL supports ForEach? No? Well, don't feel bad because it's called OUTER APPLY!

Loops are incredibly useful, unless you're trying to write fast T-SQL code. (Can you say [RBAR?])https://www.red-gate.com/simple-talk/sql/t-sql-programming/rbar-row-by-agonizing-row/))
Too frequently SQL Developers fall into the traditional, non-set-based mindset of iterating over tables using T-SQL's
WHILE statement. Now, I haven't seen everything, but I have seen a lot, and I've yet to see a WHILE loop that cannot be
refactored out of the algorithm unless a stored procedure is being called within the loop. There may be other cases,
but I've yet to encounter them.
