# WayCoolSql

This T-SQL series is about applying set-based techniques to problems typically implemented using slower, iterative methods (such as loops). The series is more about mindset than algorithms, but the algorithms matter and show a path forward. In short, set-based operations are faster (operationally cheaper) and declaritive (easier to debug) than other approaches.

Giving credit where credit is due, this journey started for me several years ago when I came across Brad Schulz's blog **[T-SQL Tuesday #017: APPLY: It Slices! It Dices! It Does It All!](http://bradsruminations.blogspot.com/search/label/CROSS%20APPLY)** and I had to really study it to 'get it' -- and it literally transformed my work! 

On a more humorous note, I recently re-read Brad's blog and saw that he also called this approach "waaaaay cool", when I was thinking more like **["Way Cool" Jr.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo_ITHEVMm8)**. Guess he had an even bigger impact that I realized!
